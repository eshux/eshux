### Welcome! 👋

In here you can mainly find some small projects created while learning and improving my skills in different technologies. For the past 2 years I have been putting my knowledge into more serious work projects, therefore not a lot of updates have been made here. 

But feel free to check out some of my previous projects while learning React and Vue:
- 💣 <a href='https://github.com/eshux/Minesweeper'>Minesweeper</a>
- 🎲 <a href='https://github.com/eshux/2048'>2048</a>
- 👊 <a href='https://github.com/eshux/Rock-Paper-Scissors'>Rock, paper, scissors</a></br></br>
